# Expectations-in-Systems-Integration-and-Architecture-

I expect to learn more about how computers and other technology integrate hardware and software.I think that knowing these systems will be beneficial to me in the future, both in terms of how they are constructed and how they function.I could gain a deeper understanding of current technological developments from this course, particularly how software is configured to support various systems and how devices are put together. I want to gain knowledge about the system development cycle and the operation of these systems.

I looked up more information about systems integration and architecture on Google because I do not fully understand the topic at present.This topic is directly relevant to my Grade 12 Track CSS. Based on what I had read, it covers software and hardware as well as other components that combine to form functional systems. 

I hope it gives us skills that will help us be better at our chosen major ,not only in our major but also to the other subjects. I hope it will pique my interest. I am eager and driven to learn since i am aware that it will improve both my academic and personal development.
